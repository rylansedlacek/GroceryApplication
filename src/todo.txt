All Actions should now check for a store first
If there is a store, then it should never prompt, just use that store.
Should be an interpreter based problem, likely nowehere else, as the
intial prompt for input is interpreter!

What we could do is add a start check if the store isnt set to NONE,
     then all input is voided, we can do this with an isStore bool

something like:

if (!Background.instance().getCurrentStoreName().equals("NONE")) {
    isStore = true;
    String currentStore = Background.instance().getCurrentStoreName();
} else {
    isStore = false;
}

and then in the S.O.P statements we just add a check first, before prompting
a simple nested in each if should work. AND THEN just pass the string currenStore
instead of the user input strings
